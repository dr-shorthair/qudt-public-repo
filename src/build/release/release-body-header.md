This release provides a variety of fixes and clarifications.

In parallel, we are cleaning up the method of generating our web catalog and web pages for the schemas and vocabularies, and individual pages for all schema classes, properties, and vocabulary instances. This is not part of the qudt-public-repo on GitHub, but makes it easier to explore QUDT.
